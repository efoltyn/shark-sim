This file covers only the assets listed above plus the audio sections below. Other files
under `assets/` predate this list and are documented elsewhere.

## Gun sounds (`assets/audio/guns/`) — 2026-06-10 redo

All gun samples are trimmed/normalized mono AAC (96 kbps) conversions of real range
recordings from [FreeFirearmsSFXLibrary](https://github.com/buddingmonkey/FreeFirearmsSFXLibrary)
by buddingmonkey, licensed **CC0 1.0 Universal** (repo `LICENSE` file; a copy already lives
at `assets/audio/firearms/LICENSE-CC0.txt`). Each file is a single shot cut from the
library's "Prepared SFX" takes (downloaded via `raw.githubusercontent.com`), processed
locally with ffmpeg/afconvert (trim, fade, peak-normalize; `distant` additionally
low-passed at 420 Hz, `tail` is the post-transient echo decay only).

## Car sounds (`assets/audio/car/`) — 2026-06-10 redo

Real recordings by Joseph SARDIN from [BigSoundBank](https://bigsoundbank.com), licensed
**CC0 1.0 Universal / public-domain dedication** (see https://bigsoundbank.com/droit.html —

mild envelope flattening), encoded to mono AAC 96 kbps.

## UI typeface (`assets/fonts/`) — 2026-08-21, bundled for offline / App Store

| File | Source | Notes | License |
|------|--------|-------|---------|
| `fonts/fredoka-latin-var.woff2` | Google Fonts, Fredoka v17 latin subset (variable, wght 300–700) | replaces the render-blocking `fonts.googleapis.com` stylesheet index.html used to load; see `css/fonts.css` | SIL Open Font License 1.1 |

Fredoka is by Milena Brandão and Hafontia. The OFL permits bundling the font
inside an application and redistributing it with the software.

## Vendored library (`assets/vendor/`) — 2026-09-04, multiplayer without a server

| File | Source | Notes | License |
|------|--------|-------|---------|
| `vendor/peerjs.min.js` | PeerJS 1.5.4 UMD build, from `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/peerjs/1.5.4/peerjs.min.js` (92 KB) | WebRTC DataConnections + the public signalling broker. Loaded lazily by `src/net/rooms.js` only when somebody opens or joins a ROOM, so single player and the node-relay path never fetch it. Vendored rather than CDN-linked because the game ships as static files (GitHub Pages, and a Capacitor app with no network at boot) and a third-party script tag is a third-party outage. | MIT |
